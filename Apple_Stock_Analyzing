## Using the attribute "info" we can extract information about the stock as a Python dictionary.

apple_info=apple.info
apple_info

## We can get the 'country' using the key country

apple_info['country']

### Extracting Share Price

A share is the single smallest part of a company's stock  that you can buy, the prices of these shares fluctuate over time. 
Using the history()method we can get the share price of the stock over a certain period of time. Using the `period` parameter we can set how far back from the present to get data. 
The options for `period` are 1 day (1d), 5d, 1 month (1mo) , 3mo, 6mo, 1 year (1y), 2y, 5y, 10y, ytd, and max.

apple_share_price_data = apple.history(period="max")

## The format that the data is returned in is a Pandas DataFrame. 
With the `Date` as the index the share `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`, and `Stock Splits` are given for each day.

apple_share_price_data.head()

## We can reset the index of the DataFrame with the `reset_index` function. We also set the `inplace` paramter to `True` so the change takes place to the DataFrame itself.

apple_share_price_data.reset_index(inplace=True)

## We can plot the `Open` price against the `Date`:

apple_share_price_data.plot(x="Date", y="Open")

### Extracting Dividends

## Dividends are the distribution of a companys profits to shareholders. 
In this case they are defined as an amount of money returned per share an investor owns. 
Using the variable `dividends` we can get a dataframe of the data. The period of the data is given by the period defined in the 'history\` function.

apple.dividends

## We can plot the dividends overtime:

apple.dividends.plot()
